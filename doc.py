Program was developed for behavior experiments with weakly electrical fish. Program can
record video with multiple cameras, both webcams or built-ins or in case of
Raspberry Pi, also PiCam. The program keeps books via odML Python package, developed by
G-Node.

== OPTIONS ==
-t --template           -- choose your template by its name
-k --stop_time          -- define a stop time for your recording; Formats: "HH:MM:SS" and "YY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS"
-o --output_directory   -- define the output directory of your recordings
-s --instant_start      -- start the recording instantly without user input
-i --idle_screen        -- do not display the video frames; this saves quite some computational power
-c --color              -- record in color
-l --recording_length   -- limit recording length in time HH:MM:SS
-e --segmentation       -- segment the recording into multiple file. Duration of single file should be set by HH:MM:SS

Bookkeeping is implemented with odML, which offers .xml templates for varios experiments.
